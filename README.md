Hello! 

What you see here is my first React app, which purpose was to simulate the functioning of an elevator. The idea to make it was in my head for quite some time, but I decided to do it when I realized that I am not sure if I can utilize React ideas I learned from a course. After completing the project, I now see that learning through practice is the best way to go. 

I kind of fell in love with my Elevelator, so I'm planning to update it every once in a while. The next features/changes you may expect are: 

1. Refactoring the code: plenty of things are still written like they are only supposed to work, not work excellently
2. Using CSS modules: I planned to do it from the go, but I encountered some npm/create-react-app troubles along the way, so I skipped that step
3. Tweaking the elevator alghoritm: currently, it only recognizes a few scenarios and although they may cover 80% of the use case, it's very likely that you can still crash it
4. Random elevator configuration at the page opening
